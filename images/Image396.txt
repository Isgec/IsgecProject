Text{<b>What is ‘Life in Lines’?</b> LIFE in Lines or LiL is a concept that aims to enable anyone to record moments from his life. It is accessible to everyone as different input mechanisms have been included to allow posting of thoughts either directly on the Website or via an e-mail, as a gtalk message, an SMS or an MMS. You can also call a 10-digit landline number which will record your voice and the recording will be posted to your account. The last is a unique endeavour that is not offered by any other site in India. The best thing about LiL is that people talk about stuff that they would never do otherwise. <b>How does it work?</b> You have to register on the site, www.lifeinlines.com, create your account, have your e-mail address, g-talk ID and phone number validated, and then start using it. <B>How does the voice recording option work?</b> The landline number is interfaced with a server system, which records your voice, and based on the caller identity, posts it to your account. If you have authenticated your number on the LiL website, the server will recognise your caller ID and record your thoughts. If you are calling from a different phone, you need to validate your registered phone number and PIN, which you can decide once you register on the site. <b>How did you think of the concept?</b> The idea was born in June last year, when I met Harpreet, a senior from IIT Bombay, after many years. We spent a lot of time catching up and that’s when we thought it would great to archive little moments from our lives so that friends could keep in touch on a regular basis. There is so much happening in our lives, but we don’t have the time to blog, scrap, send an e-mail or tell our friends about it. Also, many people balk at penning down their thoughts in a coherent, consolidated fashion that blogging is now synonymous with. Our concept, in its original form, allows people to blog in snippets, which is termed as microblogging. In India, at that point, nobody was familiar with the concept. We started by just putting in a line at a time, but as we researched the space, we managed to get it to a level where it is now unmatched in the world. Of course, there are usability issues but we are learning lessons every day in terms of making it more viable and user-friendly. <b>How did you go about making LiL a workable proposition?</b> It started with a Word document I made based on my discussion with Harpreet. Soon, another friend, Shivshankar Kumar, who was two years my junior at IIT, caught up with a coder and a designer to work on the prototype. Developing the prototype gave us a lot of insights into the issues we were looking at and the kind of features that would be interesting to the users. But after a couple of months of debating and refining the prototype, we had to put the project on the back-burner because we got busy with studies and life, and then lost touch with each other. Then, around December the same year, I discussed the idea at some conferences organised by The Indus Entrepreneurs, a group promoting enterprise. This led me to Deepak Daftari, a Kolkata-based entrepreneur who is in e-learning. He, in turn, introduced me to Nirjhareswar Banerjee, CEO of Apex Division. The company deals in MS-DOS applications for outsourcing clients. Neer agreed to handle the technical allotment. Together, we took the project forward. We were determined to start before February this year and I wanted to do this before my IIM Calcutta convocation—I even opted out of campus placements— because I wanted to have something to show before I left college. But that meant we rushed through some things, while a few aspects of the site will have to be redone. The site is functionally perfect, but we feel the user experience can be refined further. <b>Where did you get the funding for the project?</b> At the moment, it’s my mom. The project required a few lakhs —the voice-input system did not come cheap—but I’ve not reach out for funding yet. You have to have proof of the workability of a concept before you can expect somebody to invest in it. We are confident of LiL, but we want to give it enough time before we approach institutional investors. <B>Were you sure the idea would work when you decided to opt out of campus placements?</b> I had opted out of summer placements as well, but for a long time I wasn’t 100 per cent sure whether I would opt out of the campus placements entirely. By January, I had made progress with the development of LiL, and also initiated registration for OneLife Knowledge Services, a private limited company to handle it. That’s when I decided to go the whole hog with LiL. In a way I was always sure about doing my own thing. I have always been involved with the student entrepreneurial cell, both at IIT and IIM, and a start-up was pretty much my game plan. Every morning we’d brainstorm start-up ideas and discard them, but LiL was always at the back of my mind. In fact, during my IIM interview, I was asked if I’d pick a job in India or opt for a high-paying job in the US. The interviewer was surprised when I gave a third option. I told him that I had opted out of placements at IIT and planned to do the same at IIM. That probably clinched it for me. So I was 95 per cent sure I’d opt out of placements and the remaining 5 per cent was decided by January 2008. <b>How will LiL generate revenues? When do you expect to start making money?</b> At the moment, in the community Web space, it’s more about getting users. If there are enough people using your product, there is a good chance that you will draw the attention of advertisers. You can also capitalise on various ways that you can use the data about people. At the moment, we are not sure about the money-making part. We don’t expect LiL to make big money in the next one year. It all depends on when we cross the critical mass level. Right now, we are focusing on garnering eyeballs. Unless you get the user base in place, you don’t know how the market is going to respond to the product, and hence all projections of revenue are pointless. <b>Are you sure you won’t regret picking LiL over a big pay packet at the placements?</b> How much money quantifies as a “fat” pay packet? If I crack it, at the end of the day, I’ll be making a lot more money with LiL. When you make projections in the Web space, you never talk of less than a few million dollars in terms of anticipated returns. And if it does not work out by the end of the year, I can always go back to the other option and get the money. But even my Plan B—if I chalk up one—does not include going back to a job. I’m experimenting with a whole lot of things, and I’m sure something will work out. <b>What has been the biggest roadblock so far?</b> Putting together a team. Not many people are willing to jump into a start-up. And if they do not share my faith in the product, it does not make sense to rope them in. To absorb someone into the team as a stakeholder, there has to be a high mutual comfort level. So for about six months, I was flying solo. That was a hassle because there is nobody to bounce ideas and cross-check moves with. Thankfully, Maninder Gulati, a senior from IIM, got hooked to the idea and joined me. He chucked a job developing fine fragrances with ITC to join me full-time. That’s my biggest achievement so far. <b>What are the top three things going for LiL?</b> We, the LiL team, love the product and people love us. We are now making sure there is adequate amount of innovation to make it stand out in the crowd. <b>Your future plans for LiL...</b> In five years, LiL will be a lot more stable in terms of features and functionality. It is stable enough in technical terms. We want to add the latest technologies to the site as soon as we have access to them. For instance, we want to explore the voice transcription service, which means that if I make a recording on LiL on the voice system, it can be transcribed and posted because it would make it searchable. The ultimate objective is to enable simpler and better access channels. <b>Do you see OneLife Knowledge Services going beyond LiL?</b> It already is. OneLife is a consulting arm as well. My partner and I are engaged with a few companies, helping them with strategies, sales planning, etc. We decided to do this because in Web space there are aspects that the technical team has to work on, which means that I don’t have anything to do for three days at a stretch. So we could fit in consulting too. And we see some synergy between consulting and our work at LiL. The former is going to add a lot more leverage to our access to the corporate market when we move that way later. It also broadens our exposure and makes money for us. <b>Any tips for those aspiring to a start-up in the Web space?</b> Be sure and be patient. With the kind of action and biggies in the space, it’s going to be difficult to get your identity across unless you have a significant innovation to offer, a differentiation that you can sustain. This is especially true for user-generated content sites. You have to be patient because you’ll learn a lot of lessons as you go along. As they teach us in b-school, any start-up will take twice the money and thrice the time that you had anticipated. So you have to be prepared for a 6x factor to your projections. In the online world there is the added complication of viability—reaching out to people is far more difficult than it sounds. <b>What has been your best financial move so far?</b> Our first revenues came from a source that we did not anticipate. We created a customised group solution for ITC internship students from various IITs to record their learning experiences. That’s where we realised the huge potential of the idea. From the HR point of view, it would be a boon because it would help them understand a person better and the company would get live feedback. We are yet to put together a proper product, but if it takes off, it is going to be big. <b>You biggest regret...</b> None. My failures have taught me more than my achievements. <b>What is the one thing/idea you’d like to leave behind?</b> I believe in the concept of one life. I tell people to forget about the destination; just live the journey well so that it’s worth it. That’s what I’d like to leave behind. As told to Sushmita Choudhury  EOF8}
